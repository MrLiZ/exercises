'''
Four integers A, B, C and D are given. A shuffle of them is any zero-indexed array S consisting of these four integers in some order. If all the given integers are unique, then there are 24 different shuffles of them.

The best shuffle of the given integers is any shuffle S of them such that the value of:

  F(S) = abs(S[0]-S[1]) + abs(S[1]-S[2]) + abs(S[2]-S[3])

is maximal.

Write a function:

    def solution(A, B, C, D) 

that, given four integers A, B, C and D, finds their best shuffle S and returns the value of F(S).

For example, consider the following integers:

  A = 5    B = 3    C = -1    D = 5

The best shuffle of them is as follows:

  S[0] =  5
  S[1] = -1
  S[2] =  5
  S[3] =  3

and the result is F(S) = 14.

Assume that:

        A, B, C and D are integers within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].

Complexity:

        expected worst-case time complexity is O(1);
        expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
